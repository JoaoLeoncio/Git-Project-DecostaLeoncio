          A blooper is a short clip from a film or video production, usually a
          deleted scene, containing a mistake made by a member of the cast or
          crew. It also refers to an error made during a live radio or TV
          broadcast or news report, usually in terms of misspoken words or
          technical errors. The term blooper was popularized in the 1950s and
          1960s in a series of record albums produced by Kermit Schafer entitled
          Pardon My Blooper, in which the definition of a blooper is thus given
          by the record series' narrator: "Unintended indiscretions before
          microphone and camera."

          Since it first aired in 2005, the mockumentary sitcom The Office has
          earned itself a loyal following. Whether this popularity is a result
          of its unique and at times cringe-worthy humor, its heartwarming
          narratives (such as Jim and Pam's story), its lovable cast, or a
          combination of all three, The Office has rightfully earned its
          reputation as a feel-good, reliable source of entertainment. While the
          show's nine seasons are packed to the brim with funny moments, you may
          already be able to recite most of them. But it turns out there are
          even more laughs in its bloopers and deleted scenes, which we've
          compiled for your viewing pleasure ahead. We were able to find hours'
          worth of original content, so grab a snack, relax, and get ready to
          laugh!
