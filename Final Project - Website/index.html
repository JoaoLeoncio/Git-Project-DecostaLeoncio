      <h2>The Office (American TV series)</h2>
      <p>
        The Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series that
        depicts the everyday work lives of office employees at the Scranton,
        Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. It
        aired on NBC from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, spanning a total of
        nine seasons. Based on the 2001-2003 BBC series of the same name created
        by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, it was adapted for American
        television by Greg Daniels, a veteran writer for Saturday Night Live,
        King of the Hill, and The Simpsons. It was co-produced by Daniels'
        Deedle-Dee Productions and Reveille Productions (later Shine America),
        in association with Universal Television. The original executive
        producers were Daniels, Gervais, Merchant, Howard Klein, and Ben
        Silverman, with numerous others being promoted in later seasons.

        Like its British counterpart, the series was filmed in a single-camera
        setup without a studio audience or a laugh track to simulate the look of
        an actual documentary. The series debuted on NBC as a mid-season
        replacement and aired 201 episodes for its run. The Office originally
        featured Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and
        B. J. Novak as the main cast; however, the series experienced numerous
        changes to its ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the
        original main cast include Ed Helms, Rashida Jones, Amy Ryan, Mindy
        Kaling, Craig Robinson, James Spader, Ellie Kemper, and Catherine Tate.

        The Office was met with mixed reviews during its short first season, but
        the following seasons, particularly Carell's performance, received
        significant acclaim from television critics as the show's characters,
        content, structure, and tone diverged considerably from the original
        British series. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end
        top TV series lists, winning several awards such as a Peabody Award in
        2006, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, a Golden Globe Award for Carell's
        performance, and four Primetime Emmy Awards, including one for
        Outstanding Comedy Series, in 2006. The eighth season was criticized for
        a decline in quality, with Carell's departure in season seven seen as a
        contributing factor. However, the ninth and final season ended the
        series with a generally positive response. The series finale, which
        originally aired on May 16, 2013, was viewed by an estimated 5.7 million
        viewers and garnered critical acclaim. In 2016, Rolling Stone named The
        Office one of the 100 greatest television shows of all time.
